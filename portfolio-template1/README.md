Portfolio Website

This is a five (5) page website that includes a simple design that can be used and changed easily. It is mobile friendly. I tried to Label what part of the code is what for easier navigation.

The dimensions of the placeholder images are not correct sizing so play around with dimensions as you please.

<!---------------Table of contents------------>

index- The page that loads in when you first load up the website.

about- A simple about page to add a photo, title, and info.

assets- Where I stored the images that are used in the website.

project 1,2,3 - Includes 3 pages for 3 different projects that have space for a title, an image, description, extra info, and a carousel of images.

stylesheets- This is where the custom css is along with the @media for mobile friendly design is. I tried my best to make it easy to know what page of the website corresponds to the section of CSS.

<!-------------Before deploying read this------------->

! Feel free to use this template but I would apprecitate design credits in the index page !

<!-------How to deploy when you are ready--------->

When all of the info you want to add is in the project it can be up and running using a hosting website such as Netlify that is able to host web applications and static websites.
